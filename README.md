## About The Project
ðŸ‘‰ This project is my first attempt at scraping product information, focusing on a trending item in my environment lately called Basreng. Since there are multiple products and categories, I was overwhelmed by the large number of similar products available on the e-commerce platform. To tackle this, I decided to collect extensive data on Basreng to analyze and identify the best and most worthwhile options to buy.
